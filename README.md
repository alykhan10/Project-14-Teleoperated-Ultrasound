# Project-14-Teleoperated-Ultrasound
# Simulating Kinematics of a 7-DOF Robot for Detection of Fetal Defects

● Calculated Jacobians and joint torques for probe control using Newton-Euler dynamics under 14 constraints                 
● Executed end-effector path planning across a 10x10 phantom grid in MATLAB with Cartesian and joint parameters           
● Evaluated Wiener, Morphological and Wavelet filters on ultrasound scans via PSNR and SSIM metrics in Python
